## 2.2. System Components

The system is comprised of two main components namely:

1. Booking Portal:  
   This is used by travelers to perform booking of relevant port health services. Travelers' information should be completed online at [afyamsafiri@moh.go.tz](mailto:afyamsafiri@moh.go.tz) based on travel advisory. The surveillance form should be completed by both international and domestic travelers. For international travelers, it should be completed at all times 24 hours before arrival to Tanzania. For domestic travelers, the surveillance form should be completed during public health emergencies, 24 hours before departure.

2. Manager Portal:  
   This is used by Port Health Officers at the point of entry (POE) to manage travelerâ€™s bookings and generate required reports. It is accessed through [https://afyamsafiri-admin.moh.go.tz](https://afyamsafiri-admin.moh.go.tz) but with special permission from the Ministry of Health. Access to each of the components is described in more detail in the next section.
