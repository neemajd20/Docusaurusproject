## 1.1. Background

The Afyamsafiri system is a web-based platform developed by the Ministry of Health in Tanzania to enhance surveillance of travelers at points of entry on the mainland. Its primary goal is to assist in the early detection and response to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) in alignment with the core capacities of the International Health Regulations (IHR).

The system is utilized by both travelers and Port Health Authorities, and it has been integrated with the Government Electronic Payment Gateway (GePG) to support online payments. Additionally, the Afyamsafiri system facilitates the electronic implementation of other port health core functions.

### Key Functions:

-Travelers: Both international and domestic travelers are required to submit their travel information, travel history, and health information at least 24 hours before arrival or departure.
  -Purpose: This data helps Port Health Officers prepare for the screening process and manage any logistical arrangements, especially for travelers who are unwell.

For Travelers: The system is accessible over the internet using a web browser at https://afyamsafiri.moh.go.tz.
For PoE Officers: The system is accessible over the internet using a web browser at https://afyamsafiri-admin.moh.go.tz
